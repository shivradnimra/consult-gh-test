      <h2>Bias and Discrimination</h2>
      <p>One of the most pressing concerns is the issue of bias and discrimination inherent in AI systems. Large language models are trained on vast amounts of data, which can reflect and amplify existing societal biases. For instance, if the training data contains discriminatory language or stereotypes, the model may learn to replicate these biases, leading to unfair outcomes in applications such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement.</p>

      <h2>Privacy and Data Security</h2>
      <p>AI systems, particularly those relying on large language models, often require vast amounts of personal data to function effectively. This raises significant privacy concerns as sensitive information can be compromised through data breaches or misuse. Moreover, the collection and processing of personal data can lead to surveillance and profiling, eroding individual privacy rights.</p>
